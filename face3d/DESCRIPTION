Description: Tools to analyse data in the form of three-dimensional facial
             surfaces, such as those arising from laser scanning or  
             stereo-photogrammetry.  Some functions can handle surfaces of any type 
             while other functions are tailored to human faces.  Some tools are for 
             organising and manipulating the data through operations such as reading, 
             structuring, subsetting and displaying.  Other tools allow the 
             identification of specific features, particularly for facial images.  
             Tools for statistical modelling are also provided.
